# Development Workflow

## Getting Started
- Run `npm run dev` to start development server on port 3000
- Use `npm run build` to create production build
- Use `npm run preview` to preview production build
- Use `npm run lint` to check code quality

## Git Workflow
- Current branch: `migrate-to-vite` (migration from previous build system)
- Follow conventional commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Test changes before committing

## File Organization
- Keep related files together
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Separate concerns (UI, logic, data)
- Maintain clean import/export structure

## State Management
- Use Zustand store for global state
- Keep local state minimal and focused
- Implement proper state updates
- Handle edge cases and error states

## Component Development
- Start with simple components and compose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Test components in isolation
- Document component APIs

## Performance Considerations
- Monitor bundle size
- Use code splitting where appropriate
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Deployment
- Build process outputs to `dist/` directory
- Configured for Vercel deployment
- Environment variables for production
- Proper error handling for production builds
